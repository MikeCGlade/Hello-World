# Hello-World
--> The Rules are Simple: One "Hello World!" per language. (you can edit previously made hello worlds using the same language, but no copies)!!
(You can also spice it up by turning it into a game which ends with the same result). 

The idea is that this repository will be a constantly evolving game of printing "Hello World!" across a mutlitude of programming languages.
Mutate to your hearts content.
