# Hello-World

Warning: The game expects overwrites. 

--> The Rules are Simple: One "Hello World!" per language. Each language is subject to mutation. No duplicate language files.
*** The main idea is that this repository will be a constantly evolving game of printing "Hello World!" across multiple programming languages.

Ranging from complex to simplistic levels of comprehension. 

/* Have fun */
